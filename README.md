# Deep-Learning_FaceMask
Classifying problem user case using Deep Learning library from PyTorch. Dataset using image from Kaggle with two class, there are with mask and without mask. Using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method to classifying between image with wearing mask and not wearing mask.
