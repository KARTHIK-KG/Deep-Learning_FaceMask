# Deep-Learning_FaceMask
Classifying problem user case using Deep Learning library from PyTorch. Dataset using image from Kaggle with two class, there are with mask and without mask. Using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method to classifying between image with wearing mask and not wearing mask.

## Overview

In this project, i want to classifying the image between image that showing a man/woman wear mask or not using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to make the process more efficient and agile when we have a lot of image data with raw resolution image 1200 x 1800 px. The Architecture for CNN here it's a simple architecture, i will use another popular architecture in another project.
